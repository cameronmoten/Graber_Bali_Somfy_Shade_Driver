# Graber Shade Driver
 Hubitat Driver For Graber Virtual Cord Z-Wave Shades

**Notes:**
1. This driver does not currently support secure communications. Security support could be added if needed for other compatible shades.  The Graber Virtual Cord Shades do not allow you to select secure inclusion, so adding security support was not a priority.

**To use this driver:**

1. Install the driver code.
2. If you already have Graber shades installed, switch their drivers to use this driver.
3. If you are pairing new shades, this driver should be automatically selected during the inclusion process if this driver is installed.
